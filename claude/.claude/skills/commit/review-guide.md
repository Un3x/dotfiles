# Review guide for a large PR

Read at `/ship` phase 4 and at `gh pr create` when the PR cannot be read commit by commit in one sitting: roughly more than ten commits, or generated files outweighing the hand-written change. Model: Loïc's guide for Apistration #395 (545 files, 46 000 lines, 2026-09), https://assets.delmai.re/apistration-pr-395/.

Write `.notes/<branch>/review-guide.md` in the PR's language, these sections in this order:

1. **Vue d'ensemble** — what changed in one sentence, then the deliverables per surface (routes, docs, SDKs, UI…).
2. **Exemple de bout en bout** — one concrete case followed through every stage the change touches, from declaration to what the caller or the user sees.
3. **Architecture** — the layers the change adds or moves, one paragraph each, and the notable refactorings.
4. **Gardes-fous** — the tests that keep the pieces from diverging, what they cover, what they do not.
5. **Commits & tests** — the commits in reading order, each with « ce qu'il faut lire » (the files and the idea, not the diff), and the commands to run locally. Split the essential hand-written lines from the skimmable generated ones, with the counts.

The guide is handed to Thomas, who publishes it and links it from the PR body's third line. It never replaces the commits: it tells the reviewer which one to open next.
